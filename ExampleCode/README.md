Example code
============

| Example  | Framework           | Description                                          |
| -------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Example1 | Arduino/TeensyDuino | Basic example. Shows which pins to use and how to configure them. Then it turns on output 0 and blinks the other 9 on and off |
| Example2 | Arduino/TeensyDuino | Same as Example1 but uses a custom class to control the board's outputs |
| Example3 | Arduino/TeensyDuino | Uses the class from Example2 to toggle the outputs when asked to do so by receiving data from the USB serial port |
